>\'Pick a migratory species of your choice and build a tool that shows the distribution of their available habitats, and track their sightings in real time!\'

TrackWild is a community-based tool that allows users to track, identify and conserve migratory species in their area. Users will be able to:
* Track migrating species - using both animal profiles and crowdsources images and tweets, users will be able to predict when migratory species should be in their area.
* Search their location for conservation tips and efforts - information relating to migratory species in the area will be available for users to use with the aim of increasing survival rates. Local organisations working towards this goal will also be listed. These can both be submitted and reviewed by users. 
* Submit evidence of migratory species in the area - with the help of bird identification information, users can take pictures of and identify local birds, uploading them to the app to further track the progression of migration.
* Compare data with previous years - calculate if animal presence is increasing or decreasing in an area by comparing data from previous years - with the aim of finding issues that are potential barriers or facilitators to migration. 
* Submit weather conditions for their area at intervals - allowing for the correlation of weather data with population numbers.
